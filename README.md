# Progress

It ain't done yet, but it's got some gems already. Take a peek.

If you like what you see then remember: it's all MIT licensed. And we do like hearing that you used it.

# Game Fish

### What?

A game creation library with a ton of great utilities.

**Planned:**
- FPS Kit
- Vehicle Kit
- Platformer Kit

They would all be able interact with each other where it makes sense.

### Why?

Games share lots of code, reuse lots of systems.

It'd be alot easier if you didn't waste time reinventing the wheel.

This effort is about allowing you to not do that and just make your game.
